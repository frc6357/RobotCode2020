# robot_code_2020

This is the source code for all of FRC team 6357's code from the 2020 FRC game, Infinite Recharge. FRC team 6357 the Spring Konstant is a FIRST Robotics Competition team based out of Dripping Springs Texas made up of 25, 9th - 12th graders from Dripping Springs High School. 6357 has been to the world championships in Houston in 2017 and 2018, and in 2018 started FTC team 13760 at Sycamore Springs Middle School. We are consistently involved in Stem outreach events whether through STEM day, Christmas on Mercer, Science Nights and other community actvities.

All new code is to be set up on the Develop branch, and when things are being added onto the robot to be shifted over to bringup, and when everything is working move it all over to master. All code is checked to be working via Travis-CI and to merge to master are required to be independently reviewed.
